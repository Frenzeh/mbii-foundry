> A visual content editor for **Movie Battles II**. Shape classes, sabers, and vehicles without wrestling raw config syntax.

**Status:** Very aalpha — works end-to-end for `.mbch` editing, other formats rolling in. Rough edges expected; feedback welcome.

---

## What it does

MBII Foundry is a standalone desktop app that replaces hand-editing MBII's text-based content files. Open a class file, tick boxes for weapons and force powers, slide attribute levels — save back to a clean, valid file every time.

| File type | Editor | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `.mbch` | Character / class | Primary focus. Full attribute grid, force-power picker, weapon selection, class flags, Legends point-buy simulator. |
| `.sab`  | Saber config | Hilt, blade, style, stats. |
| `.veh`  | Vehicle | Base stats, weapons, flags. |
| `.siege` | Siege / FA config | Round rules, class rosters. |

Plus:

- **Asset browser** — peek at models/textures/sounds directly from PK3s.
- **Modpack packager** — bundle your edits into a loadable pk3.
- **Validation** — prevents the common "typo in enum → crash on map load" class of bug.

## Who it's for

- **Content creators** building custom classes and modpacks.
- **Balance designers** iterating on FA attribute costs and class power levels.
- **Players** who want to tweak loadouts without learning the file format.

You do not need to be a programmer. You do not need any AI assistant or backend service. The app works on its own.

## Install

There are two install paths. **Most people want the Easy Path.** Only use "From Source" if you're on the bleeding edge or there's no prebuilt release for your platform yet.

### Easy Path — prebuilt download (not yet available)

1. Open the [Releases page](https://github.com/Frenzeh/mbii-foundry/releases).
2. Find the latest release → scroll to **Assets**.
3. Download the file for your OS:
   - macOS → `MBII.Foundry.app.zip`  → unzip → drag to **Applications**.
   - Windows → `mbii-foundry-windows.zip` → unzip anywhere → double-click `mbii-foundry.exe`.
   - Linux → `mbii-foundry-linux.tar.gz` → extract → `./mbii-foundry`.
4. Launch. First run will ask for your **MBII gamedata path** (the folder with the `MBII` subfolder inside your Jedi Academy install). Point it there.

> **Status note:** MBII Foundry is alpha; no prebuilt Releases exist yet. Until one does, use "From Source" below.

### From Source — for alpha testers and contributors

You need **Go 1.21 or newer** installed. Go is free and fast to set up.

**Install Go (one-time):**
- **macOS:** `brew install go` (or download from [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/))
- **Windows:** download the MSI from [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/) and run it
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):** `sudo apt install golang` (Fedora/Arch users already know the drill)

Verify: open a terminal and run `go version`. If it prints a version, you're set.

**Build and launch MBII Foundry:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Frenzeh/mbii-foundry.git
cd mbii-foundry
./setup_mbii-foundry.sh      # builds the app (first time only, takes ~1 minute)
./run_mbii-foundry.sh        # launches the app
```

On **Windows**, use the same commands from a Git Bash or WSL terminal. If you're in PowerShell/cmd, run `cd go_module && go build -o mbii-foundry.exe` then double-click `mbii-foundry.exe`.

**Want a double-clickable Mac app?** After `setup_mbii-foundry.sh`, run `./build_app.sh`. You'll get `MBII Foundry.app` you can drag into Applications.

### Update to the latest version

Pull and rebuild:

```bash
cd mbii-foundry
git pull
./setup_mbii-foundry.sh     # rebuilds the binary with the new code
```

If you're editing your own branch, `git pull` won't work — `git fetch && git merge origin/main` instead. Ask an existing contributor if you're unsure.

### Where do I find `.mbch` files to edit?

MBII Foundry edits files; it doesn't ship with any. The `.mbch` / `.sab` / `.veh` files you'll want to open live in the **MBII TextAssets repo**, or inside your Jedi Academy install's MBII PK3s.

- **To edit official MBII content and contribute back:** clone [`MBII/TextAssets`](https://github.com/MBII/TextAssets). Edit in Foundry → commit → push → MBII's CI builds a pk3.
- **To browse files already inside your MBII install:** point the app's "Gamedata path" setting at your `GameData` directory. Foundry's asset browser can peek into the pk3s.

### Getting help

- App crashes on launch? Check the log at `go_module/mbii-foundry.log` (or `mbii-foundry.log` next to the binary).
- Build failed? Re-read the Go version message (`go version` must print 1.21+) and file an [issue](https://github.com/Frenzeh/mbii-foundry/issues) with the error output.
- Gamedata path? You're looking for the folder that contains `base/` and `MBII/` subfolders — that's your Jedi Academy `GameData` install directory.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. Priority areas during alpha:

- **Writing / fixing enum documentation** — the highest-leverage contribution for anyone who isn't a programmer. Many `definitions/<category>/*.md` files are AI-generated stubs or placeholders. Editing them directly on GitHub (pencil icon → Propose changes) works; no git clone needed. Full walkthrough: [`docs/DEFINITIONS_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEFINITIONS_GUIDE.md).
- **Bug reports** — especially anything that crashes the app or produces a `.mbch` that MBII won't load.
- **UI polish** — Fyne tooltips, layout tweaks, keyboard shortcuts.
- **Code contributions** — see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the developer guide.

Some MBII enums (`MB_ATT_*`, `WP_*`, etc.) are curated from the game's source — when new ones land, a maintainer regenerates the stubs and the community polishes the prose.
